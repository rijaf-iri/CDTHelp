## Merge two CDT station data format files `r anchor.point('merge.cdtdata')`

If you want to combine two CDT station data formats from two different files into one file, use `r menuselection('Data Preparation', 'Manipulating CDT Station Data', 'Merge two CDT Station Data')`, it will display a dialog box.

`r put.image("images/data_prepraration/merge_filter_cdt_data/merge2_cdt_data.gif", height = 50, width = 55)`

1. Select the the first CDT station data with the drop down list if it is already loaded, or open it through `r button('...')`
2. Select the second CDT station data.
3. Enter the name of the file to save the merged CDT station data or the full path to the file. You can also click on `r button('...')`, it opens a file dialog where you can select or type the name, path and type of file (txt or csv).

Click on the button ![][executetask] to execute. 

## Filtering CDT station data format `r anchor.point('filter.cdtdata')`

If you want to include or exclude stations with a given percentage of available data from a CDT station data format, use `r menuselection('Data Preparation', 'Manipulating CDT Station Data', 'Filtering CDT Station Data')`, it will display a dialog box.

`r put.image("images/data_prepraration/merge_filter_cdt_data/filter_cdt_data.gif", height = 50, width = 55)`

1. Select the file containing the station data to be filtered, if the file is not loaded yet and therefore not listed, use ![][browsebutf] to open it.
2. Select from the drop down list the operator to be used. You can use any of the following operators: __>=__ (*greater than or equal to*), __>__ (*greater than*), __<=__ (*less than or equal to*), __<__ (*less than*), and then enter the percentage of data to be filtered.
3. Enter the name of the file to save the filtered stations data or the full path to the file. You can also click on ![][browsebutf], it opens a file dialog where you can select or type the name, path and type of file (txt or csv).

Click on the button ![][executetask] to execute. 

## Selecting CDT station data format `r anchor.point('select.cdtdata')`

The menu `r menuselection('Data Preparation', 'Manipulating CDT Station Data', 'Selecting CDT Station Data')` allows to select some stations with a given percentage of available data from a CDT station data format and these stations are not included in other CDT station data.

`r put.image("images/data_prepraration/merge_filter_cdt_data/select_cdt_data.gif", height = 50, width = 55)`

1. Select the file containing the station data in which some stations will be selected, if the file is not loaded yet and therefore not listed, use ![][browsebutf] to open it.
2. Select the file containing the station data that will not be included on the output. These stations are included in (__1__), but will be excluded when filtering the data from (__1__).
3. Select from the drop down list the operator to be used. You can use any of the following operators: __>=__ (*greater than or equal to*), __>__ (*greater than*), __<=__ (*less than or equal to*), __<__ (*less than*), and then enter the percentage of data to be filtered.
4. Enter the name of the file to save the selected stations data or the full path to the file. You can also click on ![][browsebutf], it opens a file dialog where you can select or type the name, path and type of file (txt or csv).

Click on the button ![][executetask] to execute.
