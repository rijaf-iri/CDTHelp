# Filtering CDT station data format

If you want to include or exclude stations with a given percentage of available data from a CDT station data format, use `r menuselection('Data Preparation','Filtering CDT Station Data')`, it will display a dialog box.

`r put.image("images/data_prepraration/merge_filter_cdt_data/filter_cdt_data.gif", height = 50, width = 55)`

1. Select the file containing the station data to be filtered, if the file is not loaded yet and therefore not listed, use ![][browsebutf] to open it.
2. Select from the drop down list the operator to be used. You can use any of the following operators: __>=__ (*greater than or equal to*), __>__ (*greater than*), __<=__ (*less than or equal to*), __<__ (*less than*), and then enter the percentage of data to be filtered.
3. Enter the name of the file to save the filtered stations data or the full path to the file. You can also click on ![][browsebutf], it opens a file dialog where you can select the name, path and type of file (txt or csv).

Click on the button ![][executetask] to execute.
