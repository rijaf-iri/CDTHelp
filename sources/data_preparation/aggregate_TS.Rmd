The menu `r menuselection('Data Preparation', 'Aggregate Data', 'Aggregating Time Series')` allows to perform a temporal aggregation. For example, if you have daily data, you can aggregate into pentad, dekadal, monthly or seasonal data.  

`r put.image("images/data_prepraration/aggregate_data/aggregate_TS.gif", height = 70, width = 60)`

1. Select the temporal resolution of the input data to aggregate. Valid options: minutes, hourly, daily, pentad, dekadal or monthly data.
2. In case of minutes and hourly, select here the time step of the input data.
3. Select the time step in which the data will be aggregated.
	- Minutes: If the time step of input is minutes (5, 10, 15 and 30), you can aggregate it to a minutes data with a time step greater than the input.
	- Hourly: If the time step of input is minutes (5, 10, 15 and 30) or hourly (1, 3, 6 and 12), you can aggregate it to a hourly data with a time step greater than the input for hourly input data.
	- Daily: If the time step of input is minutes (5, 10, 15 and 30) or hourly (1, 3, 6 and 12), you can aggregate it to a daily data.
	- Pentad: There are 6 pentads in a calendar month. The pentad must be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6; pentad 1 (contains the days from the 1st to 5th), pentad 2 (6th to 10th), pentad 3 (11th to 15th), pentad 4 (16th to 20th), pentad 5 (21st to 25th) and pentad 6 (26th to the end of the month).
	- Dekadal: There are 3 dekads in a calendar month. The dekad must be 1, 2 or 3; dekad 1 (contains the days from the 1st to 10th), dekad 2 (11th to 20th) and dekad 3 (21st to the end of the month).
	- Monthly: The data will be aggregated monthly.
	- Annual: The data will be aggregated from January to December for each year.
	- Seasonal: The data will be aggregated for each season of the year. The length of the season varies from 2 to 12 months.
	- Rolling Seasonal: The data will be aggregated over a rolling season. For example, for a seasonal data with 3 months length, the following seasons will be calculated for each year: JFM, FMA, MAM, AMJ, MJJ, JJA, JAS, ASO, SON, OND, NDJ, DJF.

4. If the outputs are minutes or hourly, select the time step of the aggregated data.
5. If the inputs are minutes (5, 10, 15 and 30) or hourly (1 and 3) and the output time step is daily, specify here the observation hour to compute the daily data. For example: the cumulative rainfall recorded on 2018-07-30 at 9:00 is the rainfall for the day 2018-07-29.
6. If the outputs are seasonal, select the start month of the season.
7. If the outputs are seasonal or rolling seasonal, select the length of the season.
8. Select the input data format to convert.  Available data formats are: [**CDT stations data format**](cdt_data_input.html#cdt.format.data), [**CDT dataset format (gridded)**](cdt_data_input.html#cdt.dataset) and [**NetCDF gridded data**](cdt_data_input.html#cdt.ncdf.data).
9. If the input data is a *CDT station data format*, select from the drop-down list the file containing the station data to be converted if it is already loaded, or open it from the browse button ![][browsebutf] on the right. If the input data is a *CDT dataset format (gridded)*, type the full path to the index file of the CDT dataset or browse it. In case of *NetCDF gridded data*, type the full path to the folder containing the NetCDF files or browse it.
10. In case of *NetCDF gridded data*, click on the button `r button('Settings')`. A dialog box will be displayed in which you can set the date range, provide a sample file and change the filename format of the NetCDF file.

`r put.image("images/data_prepraration/aggregate_data/set_ncdf.gif", height = 30, width = 35)`

<div style="display: inline-block; float: right; width: 95%">
* (__a__) Set the date range of the data to be aggregated. See [Setting date range](cdt_data_input.html#cdt.date.range) for more details.
* (__b__) Provide a NetCDF sample file.
* (__c__) Change the filename format to conform with the NetCDF files name. See [NetCDF filename format](cdt_data_input.html#cdt.ncdf.ffrmt) for more details.
</div>  
<div style="clear: right;"></div>

11. Select the function to use to aggregate the data. Valid options: __mean__ (average), __sum__ (total), __max__ (maximum) or __min__ (minimum). If the time step of the input data is daily, a function __count__ is available which allows to compute the number of days when a variable is less or greater than a given threshold. 
12. Minimum fraction of available data that must be present within each output time step (otherwise result is missing).
13. In case of the function __count__, select the operator to be applied.
14. In case of the function __count__, specify the threshold to be used.
15. If the input data is a *CDT station data format*, type the name of the file to save the aggregated data or the full path to the file or browse it from the button ![][browsebutf] on the right. For *CDT dataset format (gridded)* and *NetCDF gridded data*, type the full path to the folder to save the aggregated data or browse it.


Click on the button ![][executetask] to aggregate the data. 

For *CDT dataset format (gridded)* and *NetCDF gridded data*, the aggregated data are saved in a new folder named **Aggregated_Data** under the folder you provided to save the output in (**15**).
