## Rainfall data

### False zero check `r anchor.point('false.zero.check')`

A false zero is an incorrect report of zero precipitation during the rainy season. The false zeros mainly come from the conversion of file with a given format to another file format, in most cases, the missing values from the original file format are not flagged and left blank, when converting the file to the other format the missing values are replaced by zeros. To check the false zeros, the percentage of zero values for each month at the target station is computed and compared to the average of the percentage of zero values for the corresponding month of the neighbor stations. If this percentage is greater than a given threshold, this month is flagged as a month containing false zeros.

To perform false-zeros check for daily rainfall data, use the menu `r menuselection('Quality Control','QC station data', 'Rainfall', 'False-Zeros check')`. It will display a tabbed widget on the left panel, allows to enter the inputs data and parameters.

The tab `r onglet('Data')` allows to enter the inputs data and set the parameters for the QC.

`r put.image("images/quality_control/quality_control/False-zero_tab-data.gif", height = 50, width = 50)`

1. Select from the drop-down list the file containing the station data to be checked if it is already loaded, or open it from the browse button ![][browsebutf] on the left.

2. Click on this button to set the parameters to be used for the false-zeros check. It displays a dialog box 

`r put.image("images/quality_control/quality_control/False-zero_fz-pars.gif", height = 50, width = 50)`

<div style="display: inline-block; float: right; width: 95%">
* (__a__) Specify the minimum number of neighbor stations to be used.
* (__b__) Specify the maximum number of neighbor stations to be used.
* (__c__) Specify the radius of search (in kilometers) to select the neighbor stations.
* (__d__) Specify the minimum number of days without missing values for each month.

If the ratio of the percentage of zero at the target station and the average of the percentage of zero of the neighbor stations is greater than this threshold the corresponding month is flagged as suspicious.
</div>  
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

3. Specify the folder to save the results by browsing it from the button ![][browsebutf] or typing the full path to the folder.
4. Click the button `r button('&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check False-Zeros &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;')` to execute.

This creates a folder named __FALSE.ZEROS.CHECK_data__ under the folder you provided (__4__) to save the results of the false zeros check. Inside this folder 2 directories and 1 file are created:

* __CDTDATASET__: directory containing all the required files used by CDT.
* __CDTSTATIONS__: directory containing the checked data, when you did a correction for the flagged months. The name of the file containing the corrected data is the same as the name of the file from the input (__1__).
* __FalseZeros.rds__: an index file, you will need to reload the outputs of the false zeros check if you want to view the results or to continue the correction later.

The tab `r onglet('False-Zeros')` allows to view the results of the false zeros check.
